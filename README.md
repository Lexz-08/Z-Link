# Z-Link
## Description
It's like an imitation of the Windows Shortcuts, except you cannot pin them to the taskbar or have custom icons.

## Features
  - Command-Line Execution
    - You can open links through command-line arguments in the program's execution.
  - Add Files/Programs
    - You can add files and programs through the program interface by clicking the '+'.
  - Remove Files/Programs
    - Basically the opposite of **Add Files/Programs**.
  - Create Links
    - Saves the added info of whatever file/program is selected in the program interface to a `.zlnk` file.
  - Open Application Directory
    - The name is self-explanatory, and the icon is a folder if you're confused.
